## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS styles
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I was able to try out some new aniamtion timelines and flows which would be a good addition to my future projects especially in making the designs more reactive, engaging and beautified.
```
<h3>Here is the css animation I like</h3>
```
```css

.wonderer{
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  border-radius: 100%;
  background-color: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  animation:  identifier 10s infinite linear;

}

@keyframes identifier {
  0% {
    position: absolute;
    left: 500px;
    top: 80px;
  }

  25% {
    position: absolute;
    left: 840px;
    top: 80px;
  }

  50% {
    position: absolute;
    left:840px;
    top: 500px;
  }

  75% {
    position: absolute;
    left: 500px;
    top: 500px;
  }

  100% {
    position: absolute;
    left: 500px;
    top: 80px;
  }
}
```

### Continued development

I will be looking further into how to use various animations in the future.
